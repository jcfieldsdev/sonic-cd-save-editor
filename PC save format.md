# *Sonic CD* for PC save file format

This is a specification for the save file format used by the Sega PC release of *Sonic CD*, released in 1996 for Windows 95. The format of this file differs significantly from the save files of the original Sega CD game.

This document uses the following terms to represent data sizes, consistent with their use in Win32 API:

| Term | Length | Range |
| - | - | - |
| **BYTE** | 1 byte (8 bits) | 0–255 |
| **WORD** | 2 bytes (16 bits) |0–65,535 |
| **DWORD** | 4 bytes (32 bits) | 0–4,294,967,295 |

All numbers are little endian integers, meaning that the word `$FF00` has the decimal value of 255 and not 65,280. All text is 7-bit ASCII.

## Overview

The file is named "s_score.dat" by default and saved in the program directory. The game can save up to 6 different save slots in a single save file. The file is always 4,324 bytes in length.

The first four bytes of the file are an integer indicating the currently selected slot. This value is **DWORD**-sized and contains a value between `$00` and `$05`.

| Offset | Size | Format | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `$0000`–`$0003` | **DWORD** | Number | Selected slot (between `$00` and `$05`)
| `$0004`–`$02D3` | 720 bytes | Section | Slot 1 |
| `$02D4`–`$05A3` | 720 bytes | Section | Slot 2 |
| `$05A4`–`$0873` | 720 bytes | Section | Slot 3 |
| `$0874`–`$0B43` | 720 bytes | Section | Slot 4 |
| `$0B44`–`$0E13` | 720 bytes | Section | Slot 5 |
| `$0E14`–`$10E3` | 720 bytes | Section | Slot 6 |

## Decoding and encoding save slots

Each save slot is encoded using a seeded pseudorandom number sequence for obfuscation. This sequence is generated by the `srand` function of C with the seed `$0551`. The output of this function is implementation-specific, so to generate the same numbers used by the game, we need to use the `msvc` compiler. Since each save slot is 720 bytes long, we need to generate 720 numbers.

The following C code can be compiled in `msvc` to generate the correct sequence:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	size_t i;

	srand(0x0551);

	for (i = 0; i < 720; i++) {
		// rand gives us a word but we only need the low byte
		printf("%02x\n", rand() & 0xff);
	}

	return 0;
}
```

This gives us a list of bytes that can be used with any other language or compiler to decode save files. Each save slot is encoded individually. To decode a save slot, we need to iterate through each byte and xor it with its corresponding byte in the `srand` sequence.

A simple JavaScript function for decoding a slot (given an array `SRAND_SEQUENCE` containing the generated numbers):

```javascript
function encodeFile(bytes) {
	return bytes.map(function(value, i) {
		return value ^ SRAND_SEQUENCE[i];
	});
}
```

Because xor is its own inverse function, the same algorithm is used to re-encode slots. Note that modified slots also need to have their checksums recalculated to be considered valid by the game.

See **Appendix A** for a sample standalone C program that reproduces the entire `srand` sequence literally (so it works in any C compiler and not only `msvc`) and decodes save files by iterating through each of the 6 sections separately.

## Slot contents

Each slot is 720 bytes long. Offsets are given relative to the beginning of the slot and not the beginning of the file. The first slot is offset by 4 bytes; the *n*th slot is offset by 4 + (*n* − 1) × 720 bytes.

| Offset | Size | Format | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `$0000`–`$0003` | **DWORD** | Number | New game |
| `$0004`–`$000F` | 12 bytes | Text | Slot name |
| `$0010`–`$0013` | **DWORD** | Number | Current Round |
| `$0014`–`$001F` | 12 bytes | Section | Date/time (see subsection) |
| `$0020`–`$02BF` | 672 bytes | Section | *Time Attack* (see subsection) |
| `$02C0`–`$02C3` | **DWORD** | Number | Total completion time |
| `$02C4` | **BYTE** | Bit field | Time Stones |
| `$02C5` | **BYTE** | Bit field | Good Futures |
| `$02C6`–`$02C7` | **WORD** | Number | Next Special Zone |
| `$02C8`–`$02CB` | **DWORD** | Number | Unknown, usually 0 but not always |
| `$02CC`–`$02CF` | **DWORD** | Number | Checksum |

### New game

`$00` for new game, `$01` otherwise.

Save slots with a value of `$00` here are ignored by the game and treated as empty regardless of the contents of the rest of the data.

### Slot name

ASCII text, used by the in-game *Saved Games* screen. The game limits this field to 10 characters, but it can be up to 12 characters long (though the last two characters will visually overlap the date/time in the interface). If the provided name is less than 12 bytes long, the game pads the last bytes as `$20`.

Underscore characters (`_`) and spaces are allowed and displayed as blank characters. Only uppercase letters and numerals are allowed. Lowercase letters and all other characters are shown as blank characters.

### Current Round

The current Round. This is used by the *Continue* option on the title screen as well as for determining which levels are available in *Time Attack*. Possible values:

| Value | *Continue* Round | Latest Round in *Time Attack* |
| - | - | - |
| `$00` | Palmtree Panic | Not available |
| `$01` | Collision Chaos | Palmtree Panic |
| `$02` | Tidal Tempest | Collision Chaos |
| `$03` | Quartz Quadrant | Tidal Tempest |
| `$04` | Wacky Workbench | Quartz Quadrant |
| `$05` | Stardust Speedway | Wacky Workbench |
| `$06` | Metallic Madness | Stardust Speedway |
| `$07` | Metallic Madness | Metallic Madness |

Completed games have a value of `$07`.

### Date/time

Saves the last modified time of each save slot.

| Offset | Size | Format | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `$0014`–`$0015` | **WORD** | Number | Year |
| `$0016`–`$0017` | **WORD** | Number | Month, between 1 and 12 |
| `$0018`–`$0019` | **WORD** | Number | Day of month, between 1 and 31 |
| `$001A`–`$001B` | **WORD** | Number | Hour, between 0 and 23 |
| `$001C`–`$001D` | **WORD** | Number | Minute, between 0 and 59 |
| `$001E`–`$001F` | **WORD** | Number | Seconds, between 0 and 59 |

Note that the month and day start at 1 and not 0 (as in some programming languages). The year is stored as a full number (for example, 1996 would be stored as `$CC07`) and not as an offset from 1900 or similar.

These values are all set to `$00` for new games.

### *Time Attack*

The game stores three different time positions for each of the 21 zones and 7 Special Zones, in the order of:

- Palmtree Panic I, 1st place
- Palmtree Panic I, 2nd place
- Palmtree Panic I, 3rd place
- Palmtree Panic II, 1st place
- Palmtree Panic II, 2nd place
- Palmtree Panic II, 3rd place
- ...
- Special Zone 6, 1st place
- Special Zone 6, 2nd place
- Special Zone 6, 3rd place
- Special Zone 7, 1st place
- Special Zone 7, 2nd place
- Special Zone 7, 3rd place

See **Appendix B** for a complete list of *Time Attack* position offsets.

Each position consists of 8 bytes:

- A **DWORD** number for the time in ticks. Default value is `$5046`, representing 5 minutes in ticks (5 × 60 × 60).
- A **DWORD** of text containing three ASCII characters representing the player's initials and one null byte (`$00`). Default value is `$414141`, representing "AAA" in ASCII.

Time in *Sonic CD* is kept in minutes, seconds, and ticks. Ticks are 1/60 of a second but displayed in-game as 1/100 of a second. The formula to convert from the stored form (1/60) to the displayed form (1/100) is ⌊ 100 × *tick* / 60 ⌋.

Uppercase letters, numerals, and spaces are allowed for initials. All other characters are shown as blank characters.

### Total completion time

The sum of all of the first-place times in the *Time Attack* mode, in ticks. This is used to determine if the *Play Music* or *Visual Mode* options are available on the title screen without having to recalculate it every time the game is started.

The total time is computed by adding all of the first-place times (excluding Special Zones) in their original, 1/60 of a second form. Adding times in their converted, 1/100 of a second form results in a slightly different time from the one presented in-game.

Default value is `$90C405`, representing 105 minutes in ticks.

### Time Stones

Tracks the Time Stones collected by the player. Each Time Stone is associated with a particular Special Zone, so they can be collected out of order if the player fails a Special Zone.

This is stored as a bit field of seven bits, each representing one Time Stone, starting with the least significant bit:

```
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  | | | | | | |
  | | | | | | Green
  | | | | | Orange
  | | | | Yellow
  | | | Blue
  | | Cyan
  | Purple
  Red
```

This can also be expressed as a sum of the powers of 2:

| Time Stone | Value |
| - | - |
| Green | 1 |
| Orange | 2 |
| Yellow | 4 |
| Blue | 8 |
| Cyan | 16 |
| Purple | 32 |
| Red | 64 |

A value of `$7F` means that all of the Time Stones have been collected.

### Good Futures

Tracks the Good Futures created by the player. A Good Future can be created in a particular Round by traveling to the Past in each of the first two Zones and finding and destroying the robot transporter machine. A Good Future is also created in each Round played after the player collects all of the Time Stones.

This is stored as a bit field of seven bits, each representing one of the game's seven Rounds, starting with the least significant bit:

```
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  | | | | | | |
  | | | | | | Palmtree Panic
  | | | | | Collision Chaos
  | | | | Tidal Tempest
  | | | Quartz Quadrant
  | | Wacky Workbench
  | Stardust Speedway
  Metallic Madness
```

This can also be expressed as a sum of the powers of 2:

| Round | Value |
| - | - |
| Palmtree Panic | 1 |
| Collision Chaos | 2 |
| Tidal Tempest | 4 |
| Quartz Quadrant | 8 |
| Wacky Workbench | 16 |
| Stardust Speedway | 32 |
| Metallic Madness | 64 |

A value of `$7F` means that all of the Good Futures have been obtained.

### Next Special Zone

The next Special Zone to be played, between `$00` and `$06`. The game goes through all of the Special Zones in rotation, skipping the ones that have already been successfully completed. This value is set to `$00` once the player has collected all of the Time Stones.

It is possible to set this value to that of a Special Zone that has already been completed. In this case, the selected Special Zone is played next but does not award another Time Stone if completed successfully (since each Special Zone is associated with a particular Time Stone).

### Checksum

The checksum is computed by iterating over the first 716 bytes of the slot (that is, the entire slot except the checksum itself) and adding each byte as a signed integer. In C, it can be calculated with the following function:

```c
int calculate_checksum(signed char bytes[]) {
	int checksum = 0;

	for (size_t i = 0; i < 716; i++) {
		checksum += bytes[i];
	}

	return checksum;
}
```

It is significant to note that the algorithm treats each byte as a *signed* integer, meaning that any value greater than `$7F` is treated as a two's complement and *reduces* the value of the checksum rather than increasing it. If we were to implement the function in a language with no concept of a signed byte type, such as JavaScript, we would need to take this into account:

```javascript
function calculateChecksum(bytes) {
	let checksum = 0;

	// adds all bytes of file as signed integers
	for (let i = 0; i < bytes.length - 4; i++) {
		if (bytes[i] < 0x80) {
			checksum += bytes[i];
		} else { // converts two's complement
			checksum -= 0xff - bytes[i] + 1;
		}
	}

	return checksum;
}
```

This means that a file can theoretically produce a negative checksum, but this can never happen with a real save file because there are not enough possible bytes in the format with valid values above `$7F`.

Slots with invalid checksums are treated as empty and ignored by the game.
